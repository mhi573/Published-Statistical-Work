# Published-Statistical-Work

### Description: 
<p>This repository highlights published peer-reviewed research journal articles co-authored by myself and my colleagues (HIV Prevention and Public Health Researchers). I contributed to these publications as the statistician and co-writer. My contributions included: 1) participating in the topic conceptualization; 2) discussing data sources and analytical plan; 3) conducting the statistical analysis, writing the Method section, Results section; and 4) manuscript copyediting.  The data for all these manuscripts come from multiple, diverse randomized controlled clinical trials and research projects. Due to the range of data collected and research areas of interest that the faculty hold, these manuscripts are published in a range of research journals and cover diverse topics. </p>

<p><i>Below is information about these publications including their title, APA citation, publishing research journal, and descriptions about my contributions, and analytical plan. I encourage the audience to read these publications (hosted above as PDFs).</i></p>

  <li><b>Analytical Plan:</b><br />First, in SPSS, we examined the bivariate associations between demographics and our other variables of interest. Then, in Mplus, we examined the associations between primary sexual identity and our outcomes using linear regression (first without covariates and then including age, race/ethnicity, and sex/gender, given evidence that they are related to bi+ individuals’ mental health. Primary sexual identity was dummy-coded with bisexual as the reference group. We also ran the analyses with pansexual as the reference group to compare pansexual and queer participants to each other. Finally, we examined the associations between multiple label use and our outcomes (first without covariates and then including age, race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and primary sexual identity). Primary sexual identity was included as an additional covariate to examine the unique associations between multiple label use and our outcomes. There were no missing data for demographics and only one participant was missing data for disclosure. Missing data ranged from 10.0% to 11.4% for all other variables and was handled using full information maximum likelihood.</ul><br /><br />
<li><b>Identifying leaks in the STEM recruitment pipeline among sexual and gender minority US secondary students</b>
  <ul><li><b>Citation:</b><br />Hall, C. D. X., Wood, C., <b>Hurtado Jr., M.</b>, Moskowitz, D. A., Dyar, C., & Mustanski, B. (2022). Identifying leaks in the STEM recruitment pipeline among sexual and gender minority US secondary students. PloS one, 17(6), e0268769. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0268769<br />
  <li><b>Publisher:</b><br />PloS one<br />
  <li><b>Analytical Plan:</b><br />Data were analyzed using SPSS 27, and all 539 participants provided data on all measures used in this study. Descriptive statistics were calculated and used to assess assumptions for planned tests (e.g. normality). A confirmatory factor analysis based on eigenvalues, using maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation was conducted to assess both of the adapted sense of belonging in STEM learning environments scales. A series of Pearson correlations were conducted to examine associations among bullying, sense of belonging in STEM learning environments, perceived STEM climate, and STEM intent. An exploratory bivariate analysis (Chi-square test of independence, and Fisher’s exact test) was conducted to examine the distribution of sexual identities, and gender identities in each intended field of study. Simple logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, bullying, sense of belonging in STEM learning environments, perceived STEM climate, and STEM intent. Following those analyses, multiple regressions were employed to generate adjusted estimates of effects on sense of belonging in STEM learning environments, perceived STEM climate, and STEM intent. Standardized beta coefficients, standard errors, and adjusted odds ratio (aOR), and 95% confidence intervals are reported accordingly. We also investigated outliers in bullying, sense of belonging in STEM learning environments, and perceived STEM climate using the interquartile range method. There was only one outlier case found within STEM bullying. We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding this case and found no differences in our results. Our approach to dealing with Type-I error rate inflation due to multiple comparisons included employing an alpha correction that adjusted the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and we report the corrected significance levels. G*Power was used to perform an a priori power analyses for linear and logistic regression analyses to determine a sufficient sample size. For small to medium effect sizes (.20 or greater) among planned linear regression analyses and a minimum odds ratio detection of 1.5 among logistic regression analyses, our analyses are well-powered (power = .99; α = .05) given our sample sizes.</ul><br /><br />
